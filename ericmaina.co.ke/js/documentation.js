//*DECOMERCE WEB APPICATION 
// features the following capabilities 

1.//*Censorship resistant since no regulatory authority or centralized system has control over it ;
//* with features such as... 

2.//*Unstoppable domains -- offers blockchain domain names that are stored on the etherum and ziliqa blockchains .These domains are censorship resistant 


//--examples of DNS systems include Namecoin . -Hanshake - ENS(EOS name service) -

3.//* Decentralized logistics network
//--with the help of smart contracts tasks can be automated  to enforce agreements.


4.//*Resilient to hacking 

5.//*Decentralized identity.
//--used to verify the identities of  users invloved in logistics  operations such as drivers warehouse  staff .and custom offficials to enhance trust in the system while ensuring data privacy


6.//* No browser required all processes occur within the browser


7.//*No permissions involed (peer to peer )

8.//*Decentralized domain naming system
/*registration is done through blockcgain domain registrars.
To acquire a domain you need to buy a Monero. Etherium or USDT wallet address then link the wallet address to you domain system
*/ 

9.//*IPFS for storing web pages 


10.//*Peer to peer to payments 


11.//*Cannot be shut down since the copies of this webpage are stored across mutiple servers across the web and each is indipendent of the other.

12.//*NO DDOS attacks since the files can be provided by many indipendent nodes.

13.//*uses consesus mechanism to ensure data is validated before being added to the blockchain

14.//*Using featurs such iexec cloud plartform which enables confidential offchain code execution and an oracle for validating information provided by the buyer  such as shipping and payment information.

//*infura service is a service that does not helps a user manage a network of nodes instead of having to run their own specificlly suited for etherium.

//security implemented using the 
//--sha3.js cryptographic hash function sha-3

//nmemonics generator for translating crpto addreses into human readable form.


//*imported libraries 
//--encoding libary
//--cryptographic algorith
//--Qr code generator
//--local forage and cache generator
//--big interger generator
//--address generator
//--Ulkit icon library 
//--Jquery styling for animating and event handling
//--Jquery for apis
