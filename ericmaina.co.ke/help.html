                                <h3>Enabling individuals to conduct transactions directly, bypassing intermediaries. Absence of intermediaries means no banks, major technology companies, or government involvement.</h3>
                                <p>DeCommerce is a software solution, similar to platforms such as WooCommerce and PrestaShop, that empowers users to operate fully independent ecommerce stores. It harnesses blockchain technologies, enabling users to connect, conduct transactions, and retain ownership over all their interactions, eliminating the need for centralized infrastructure across various domains.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hosted on IPFS</li>
                                    <li>Crypto payments</li>
                                    <li>NFT Domains</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>.DeCommerce operates differently from standard CMS systems as it lacks a backend interface. Instead, users configure settings directly within the configuration file. This file allows customization of various elements such as Bitcoin Etherium and  Monero addresses for payment receipt, menu links, and other settings. Additionally, users can update product listings by editing the JSON file I have provided directly.</p>
                                <p>Once all configurations are complete, you can seamlessly upload your website onto the IPFS network, ensuring perpetual accessibility. This process involves utilizing a pinning service like [insert service name] to facilitate the upload of your website onto IPFS. <a target="_blank" href="#">https://www.pinata.cloud/</a>, or you can run your own IPFS node like <a target="_blank" href="#">IPFS Desktop</a>.</p>
                                <i>With its maintenance-free nature, there's no need to maintain servers, databases, or related infrastructure.</i>
                                <p>The primary distinction from other CMS platforms lies in the static nature of DeCommerce. When modifications are necessary, the website must be re-uploaded, resulting in a new CID(content ID) due to updated content. This quick process typically takes less than 5 minutes. Subsequently, you'll need to redirect your NFT domain to the new CID, or utilize IPNS or DNSLink. These options enable the creation of a singular, persistent address directing to the CID for the most recent iteration of your website.</p>

                                <h2 id="censorship">Ecommerce Resilient to Censorship</h2>
<p>Censorship resistance holds critical importance in regions where governments impose stringent regulations. These restrictions often dictate permissible business activities and financial transactions, hindering genuine freedom. As a result, censorship-resistant ecommerce is indispensable for individuals unable to conduct business or execute transactions freely, devoid of government or third-party interference.</p>
<br>
                                <br>
                                <br>


                                <h2 id="ipfs">Hosted on IPFS (Distributed Web)</h2>
                                <p>IPFS, a protocol and peer-to-peer network, facilitates data storage and sharing in a distributed file system. Similar to BitTorrent, IPFS enables users to host and retrieve data. Unlike traditional servers, IPFS operates through a decentralized network of user-operators, each holding a portion of the data. This decentralized approach ensures resilience in file storage and sharing. Users can access files by their content address, and any node in the network can serve a file upon request using a distributed hash table.</p>
                                <h4>Challenges of Today's Web</h4>
                                <p>Traditional HTTP downloads files from one server at a time, whereas IPFS retrieves pieces from multiple nodes concurrently, resulting in significant bandwidth savings, particularly up to 60% for video distribution.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, the average lifespan of a web page is a few days, highlighting the fragility of today's web. IPFS offers a solution by simplifying the creation of resilient networks for data mirroring, and its content addressing feature ensures automatic versioning of stored files.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, increasing centralization of control threatens innovation on the internet. IPFS aims to uphold the original vision of an open, decentralized web, fostering innovation and equal opportunity.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, IPFS enables the creation of resilient networks that ensure persistent availability, regardless of internet backbone connectivity. This resilience improves connectivity, especially in developing regions, during natural disasters, or in areas with unreliable internet access.</p>
                                <h3>How IPFS Operates</h3>
                                <p>When a file is added to IPFS, it undergoes fragmentation, cryptographic hashing, and receives a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID). This CID serves as a permanent record of the file's state at the time of addition.</p>
                                <p>When other nodes seek the file, they query their peers for nodes storing the content referenced by the file's CID. As nodes access or download the file, they cache a copy, becoming providers of the content until their cache is cleared.</p>
                                <p>Nodes have the option to pin content to retain and provide it indefinitely or discard content that hasn't been accessed recently to conserve space. This ensures that each node stores only content of interest, along with indexing information facilitating content retrieval.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, updates to files result in new CIDs due to cryptographic hash changes, rendering files on IPFS resistant to tampering and censorship. Modifications to a file do not overwrite the original, and common chunks across files can be reused to minimize storage costs.</p>
                                <p>Despite the complexity of CIDs, IPFS offers mechanisms such as the    to simplify file retrieval using human-readable identifiers.</p>

<h2 id="nftdomains">NFT Domains (Unstoppable Domains)</h2>
<p>NFT Domains are a new type of web extension (e.g., .com or .de) deployed as smart contracts on public blockchains. These domains are stored in the owner's wallet, akin to cryptocurrencies, and cannot be seized by third parties. Once purchased, the domain remains owned for life, with no renewal fees.</p>
<p>Self-custody is a key feature of NFT Domains, granting owners complete control over their domains and enabling decentralization. The domain's storage on the blockchain, similar to a cryptocurrency, ensures this level of control.</p>
<p>With self-custody:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Domains cannot be seized by third parties.</li>
    <li>Decentralized websites can be enabled.</li>
    <li>Domains can be transferred globally within seconds without requiring permission.</li>
    <li>Owners have sole control over domain management, including adding crypto addresses and linking content.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Replacing Cryptocurrency Addresses with Human-Readable Names</h4>
<p>Domain owners can associate cryptocurrency addresses directly with their domains on the blockchain. Integrated wallets can then resolve domain names to the appropriate addresses, simplifying the payment process.</p>
<h4>Decentralization of Unstoppable Domains</h4>
<p>Unstoppable Domains are stored as NFTs in the owner's crypto wallet (Zilliqa blockchain for .zil domains and Ethereum blockchain for other TLDs). Domain management is facilitated through smart contracts, requiring wallet authentication for any changes or transactions. Unstoppable Domains has no control over domains once minted, ensuring full ownership and control for the owner.</p>

<i>* NFT Domains are optional for DeCommerce. Standard domains (.com, .de) can also be used, but they may be subject to shutdown by authorities.</i>
